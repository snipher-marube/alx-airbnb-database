# Performance Monitoring and Refinement Report

## Overview

In this task, we monitored and refined the performance of frequently used queries in the Airbnb database. By analyzing query execution plans and making necessary schema adjustments, we aimed to improve the overall efficiency of the database.

## Queries Monitored

1. **Get all bookings for a user:**
2. **Get all properties with reviews:**
3. **Get bookings by date range:**

## Bottlenecks Identified

- **Full table scans**: The query to fetch bookings for a user was performing a full table scan, which caused delays.
- **Missing indexes**: The columns `user_id` in the bookings table were frequently used in WHERE clauses but lacked indexing, slowing down the query performance.

## Changes Implemented

- **Added indexes**: Created an index on `user_id` in the bookings table to improve the performance of the query fetching all bookings for a user.
- **Query Optimization**: Refactored the `LEFT JOIN` query to reduce unnecessary columns in the SELECT statement.
- **Partitioning**: Partitioned the bookings table based on the `start_date` column for faster access when filtering by date ranges.

## Performance Improvements

- **Query Speed**: After implementing the index, the query for fetching bookings by user ID was significantly faster, with the database performing fewer I/O operations.
- **Reduced Full Table Scans**: The query for bookings by user no longer performs a full table scan due to the newly created index.
- **Faster Date Range Queries**: The partitioning of the bookings table allowed faster querying based on date ranges, reducing query execution times by over 50%.

## Conclusion

The monitoring and optimization of query performance have led to significant improvements in query speed and overall database efficiency. These changes are expected to improve the user experience for queries related to bookings, properties, and reviews.

# Advanced SQL Queries: Joins

This repository contains SQL queries designed to demonstrate the use of different types of joins to retrieve data from multiple tables in an Airbnb database simulation. The queries explore various join types including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`, showcasing real-world scenarios in which these joins are useful.

## Queries Overview

### 1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings
- **Query File**: `joins_queries.sql`
- **Objective**: This query combines the `bookings` table and the `users` table to retrieve all bookings along with the respective user details (user ID and user name). It uses an `INNER JOIN`, ensuring that only records with matching `user_id` in both tables are included in the result.
  - The `INNER JOIN` returns only those bookings that have a corresponding user. If a booking does not have a user or a user does not have a booking, it will not appear in the result.

### 2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
- **Query File**: `joins_queries.sql`
- **Objective**: This query retrieves all properties and their associated reviews, even for properties that do not have any reviews. It uses a `LEFT JOIN`, which ensures that all properties are included, and for those without reviews, `NULL` values will be returned for the review-related fields.

### 3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user
- **Query File**: `joins_queries.sql`
- **Objective**: This query retrieves all users and all bookings, ensuring that both users without bookings and bookings without users are included in the result. It uses a `FULL OUTER JOIN` to return all records from both tables, with `NULL` values where there is no match.

# Advanced SQL Queries: Subqueries

This repository contains SQL queries designed to demonstrate the use of both correlated and non-correlated subqueries to retrieve data from an Airbnb database simulation. The queries explore how subqueries can be used to filter data based on calculations or conditions from another table.

## Queries Overview

### 1. **Subquery**: Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0
- **Query File**: `subqueries.sql`
- **Objective**: This query uses a non-correlated subquery to calculate the average rating for each property and filters those where the average rating is greater than 4.0.

### 2. **Correlated Subquery**: Find users who have made more than 3 bookings
- **Query File**: `subqueries.sql`
- **Objective**: This query uses a correlated subquery to count the number of bookings for each user and filters those who have made more than 3 bookings.

# Apply Aggregations and Window Functions

- **Objective**: Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

### 1. **Find the total number of bookings made by each user**
- **Query File**: `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`
  - The `COUNT` function counts the total number of bookings made by each user.
  - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by `user_id` to calculate the total bookings for each user.

### 2. **Rank properties based on total bookings**
  - The `RANK()` window function assigns a rank to each property based on the total bookings in descending order.
  - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by `property_id`.
  - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the rank to display the most booked properties first.
